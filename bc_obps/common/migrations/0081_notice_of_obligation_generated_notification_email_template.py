            <p>Dear {{ operator_legal_name }},</p>
            <br>
            <p>You can now view your compliance obligation for the {{compliance_year}} compliance period in the BC Industrial Emissions Reporting System (BCIERS). This compliance obligation is based on the information submitted in <b>{{operation_name}}</b>’s Annual Report for the {{compliance_year}} compliance period. </p>
            <p>On <b>November 1, 2025</b>, the Ministry will issue an invoice to <b>{{operator_legal_name}}</b> based on <b>{{operation_name}}</b>’s excess emissions for the 2024 compliance period multiplied by the applicable compliance charge rate. On November 1, 2025, you will receive payment instructions and have the option to use compliance units to meet part of your obligation. </p>
            <p><b>Please note:</b> Payments cannot be made before you receive your invoice. Payments received after the payment deadline of November 30 will be subject to daily compounding penalties, as well as interest under the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> (FAA). We encourage you to make your monetary payment at least five business days in advance of the compliance obligation deadline to allow for payment processing time. </p>
