/**
 * Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that takes a unique approach to styling websites.
 * It provides a comprehensive set of pre-defined utility classes that can be used to quickly and efficiently style HTML elements.
 * Rather than writing custom CSS, developers can leverage these utility classes to apply styles and create responsive designs.
 *
 * We need to modify the tailwind.config.js file for MUI and TailwindCSS to work correctly.
 *  You can read more about it here in the MUI documentation: https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/interoperability/#setup.
