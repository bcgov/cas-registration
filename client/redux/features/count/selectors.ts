// 🎯 Selector fucntion, allowing us to retrieve a value from the Redux state.
// Selectors can also be defined inline where they're used, instead of within the slice file.
// For example: `useSelector((state: RootState) => state.counter.value)`
export const selectCount = (state: ReduxState) => state.count.value;
