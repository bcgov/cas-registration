# URL patterns to use when building report pages:

URLs shall attempt to best describe what the page contains, in an unambiguous way.
Guildelines:

- Use IDs instead of GUIDs to let users validate the URLs at a glance
- Use kebab-case (or dash-case) to stay consistent with our API routes

Goals:

- This allows the user to confirm it's the right page just by looking at the URL
- This allows the user to target each page of the report, to enter data and communicate with others
