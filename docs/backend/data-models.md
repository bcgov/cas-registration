# Data Models

This document outlines the data models used in the backend of the OBPS application. The data models are implemented using Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system, which allows us to define the data models as Python classes. The data models are stored in the `models.py` file within each Django app.

Common data models used in the OBPS application are located in the `bc_obps/common/models.py` file.

## Email Notifications

Email notifications are an essential part of the application's communication strategy. They provide users with important information, updates, and alerts. We use CHES (Common Hosted Email Service) to send email notifications to users.
To send real emails, you need to set up CHES credentials in your environment variables. You can find the required CHES credentials in the 1Password document `OBPS backend ENV`.

You also need to set up the `EmailService` singleton object (like `email_service = EmailService()`) in the `.py` file to access the `EmailService` object.

**Note**: Make sure to not send real emails in the development environment by commenting out the CHES credentials in the `bc_obps/.env` file.

## Audit Trail Implementation

Within our Django application, we employ the `TimeStampedModel` abstract data model to integrate audit columns into our various models. This model resides in `bc_obps/registration/models.py` and serves as the foundation for all data models requiring audit trails. It incorporates the following columns:

`created_at`: Captures the timestamp when an object is initially created.
`created_by`: Records the creator of the object.
`updated_at`: Indicates the timestamp of the object's last update.
`updated_by`: Stores the user who last modified the object.
`archived_at`: Documents the timestamp when an object is archived.
`archived_by`: Registers the user who initiated the archiving process.

This data model is equipped with two essential methods:

`set_create_or_update`: This method sets the necessary audit columns when creating a new object or updating an existing one. It requires the user initiating the modification as a parameter.

`set_archive`: Specifically designed for archiving objects, this method captures the archival details and requires the user initiating the archival process as a parameter.

Furthermore, a custom manager is implemented to filter out archived objects, ensuring a streamlined retrieval process focused only on active data.

## Data Models Primary Key

In Django, each model requires a primary key to uniquely identify each record in the database. By default, Django automatically adds an `id` field as the primary key for each model. However, you can customize the primary key by explicitly defining it in the model class.
In some data models we use UUID as the primary key instead of the default auto-incrementing integer field to prevent information leakage and improve security. This is achieved by using the `uuid` module in Python and the `uuid.uuid4` method to generate unique identifiers for each record. The UUID field is defined in the model class as follows:

```python
import uuid
id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
```

## Change History

We track change history for all our models with the [django-simple-history](https://django-simple-history.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package.

### History Schema

An `erc_history` schema was created alongside the "live" `erc` schema to house all the history tables. Each `erc` model has a corresponding `<table>_history` table in the `erc_history` schema that tracks and timestamps all changes. These changes are a snapshot of the data as it was at the time the change to the data was made. This enables point in time diffing either in the app or in metabase.
